A Surprising New Leader

In a shocking last minute swing, the country voted for a candidate who, only days ago, looked to be almost totally unelectable. The candidate only recently entered politics and has now led a fringe party to power. A party which has never previously garnered more than a few percent of the vote.

Politics isn't what it once was. These are volatile times and the people are eager for a leader who can change things. It's not clear what the voters want - it's not even clear that *they* know what they want - but it's clear the status quo is not it.

Thanks to his landslide victory, the new Head of State currently has a political power of 5/5 stars, according to our new rating. Be sure to follow this number throughout his sure-to-be "exciting" tenure!

------




You stand looking out of the window.

So here we are. You are the new Head of State who has had a meteoric rise to the highest office in the land, but the will of the people is a fickle thing, and you are no run-of-the-mill politican. Scandals are popping up left, right and centre; your staff are leaking damaging comments; the established parties hate you; the media is lapping it up.

You're going to have to work hard if you want to stay in power: It's already beginning to slip through your fingers...

Head of State

Official Office
Your office probably doesn't look much different now to how it did when each of your predecessors occupied it over the last century.

Portraits of stern old white men hang on the walls, a huge chandelier hangs down from the ceiling the the middle of the room. A huge dark wooden desk sits in front of your chair.

The things some men have done to make it to this room...

Your senior advisor, Martin Gavell, stands patiently in front of your desk. It looks like he's waiting for you to speak to him.

Notable Healthcare Bill Passes In a surprising move, the country's new leader has passed the much debated healthcare bill. The passing of the bill has been welcomed by many opposing politicians, however there seems to be some dissatisfaction from the premier's core voter base.

The shaking of the foundations of the Head of State's support has taken its toll. According to our latest calculations, his political power has sunk to 5/5 stars, moreover, his latest actions have raised questions around what this man really stands for.

The shaking of the foundations of the Head of State's support has taken its toll.

Perhaps this recent change of heart is the beginning of something much greater. Only time will tell.

Premier Spits on the Poor Leaks from inside the the office of our new leader suggest that he may have gone as far as spitting on the recent healthcare bill whilst refusing to sign it in a fit of rage.

These leaks, which may yet transpire to be entirely false, have already damaged the new Head of State. According to our latest calculations, his political power has sunk to 4/5 stars, and there may be more fallout in store for him.

You mutter "absolute garbage" as you rip up the bill and throw it away.

TODAY'S NEWSPAPER FRONT PAGE

Notable Healthcare Bill Passes

In a surprising move, the country's new leader has passed the much debated healthcare bill. The passing of the bill has been welcomed by many opposing politicians, however there seems to be some dissatisfaction from the premier's core voter base.

The shaking of the foundations of the Head of State's support has taken its toll. According to our latest calculations, his political power has sunk to 5/5 stars, moreover, his latest actions have raised questions around what this man really stands for.

Official Office
Your office probably doesn't look much different now to how it did when each of your predecessors occupied it over the last century.

Portraits of stern old white men hang on the walls, a huge candelier hangs down from the ceiling the the middle of the room. A huge dark wooden desk sits in front of your chair.

The things some men have done to make it to this room...

On the desk is Now the bill.

Your senior advisor, Martin Gravell, stands patiently in front of your desk.
